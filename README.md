# Dvorak Keyboard

This is the modification of Programmer Dvorak keyboard layout for MacOS.
Bundle contains two layouts:

* Slightly modified Programmer Dvorak layout.
* Russian (ЙЦУКЕН) - Programmer Dvorak (⌘)

## Modified Programmer Dvorak layout

Despite of  [original Programmer Dvorak layout](https://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/) it has `:` and `;` are replaced by each other.  It is convenient to use with programming languages without intensive use of semicolon (for example Ruby).

## Russian (ЙЦУКЕН) - Programmer Dvorak (⌘)

This is the same ЙЦУКЕН layout, but if you press ⌘ key, it acts as Modified Programmer Dvorak layout. Thus, all your hot keys will work the same way as in Programmer Dvorak layout.

## Development

It is done using awesome keyboard editor [Ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele).

## Installation

I don't provide installation package, since [Programmer Dvorak](https://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/) license forbids redistribute it with the same name. In order to install this bundle you have to build it on your own risk. Ukelele is the perfect tool for that.
